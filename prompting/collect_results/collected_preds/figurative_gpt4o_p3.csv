in the pink,"Certainly! Let's analyze the context of the expression carefully:

1. If 'in the pink' is used to describe someone being in excellent health or condition, then it holds a **figurative** meaning. (Output: 'i')
   
2. If 'in the pink' is used to describe someone or something literally being in a pink color or environment, then it holds a **literal** meaning. (Output: 'l')

So for the provided context 'In the Pink', you would need to determine if it refers to a state of health or condition (figurative) or if it is describing an actual pink color (literal). If no additional context is provided, it would typically default to the figurative meaning since that is the more common use.

go to town,"The expression ""go to town"" can be used both literally and figuratively. To determine which meaning it holds in the given context, let's analyze the sentence:

""Well Viv is stopping in, you're going to town.""

The phrase ""stopping in"" suggests someone (Viv) is coming to visit or make a brief stop. The context isn't providing a direct reason to interpret ""going to town"" literally—like mentioning errands, shopping, or visiting specific places in town.

On the other hand, if ""you're going to town"" was followed by additional details indicating spirited or enthusiastic action (a figurative usage), it would normally provide some context like, ""you're going to town on that project."" However, the sentence isn't using such phrasing either.

Given the absence of clear figurative language and typical literal cues, and assuming the example sentence is part of a typical, mundane scenario, it's plausible to default to the literal interpretation of ""going to town"" as simply visiting the town.

Therefore, the answer would be:
'l'",i
go to town,'l',i
go to town,i,i

take no prisoners,"The expression 'take no prisoners' can have both figurative and literal meanings depending on the context. Here's how to determine the meaning in the given context:

If the context implies a literal situation, such as a military or combat scenario where actual prisoners are captured or not captured, then it holds a **literal** meaning. 

If the context suggests a figurative usage, such as describing a person's uncompromising, relentless approach to a task or situation, it holds a **figurative** meaning. 

In the given sentence 'No prisoners were taken.', without additional context specifying whether this is a literal battle or a figurative statement about behavior, it's challenging to definitively determine the meaning. However, the phrase ""no prisoners were taken"" tends to be more commonly understood as a literal statement unless indicated otherwise.

Thus, given the phrase alone: 'No prisoners were taken.', the output should be 'l' for literal.",i

on the game,l,i
on the game,"To determine whether the expression ""on the game"" holds figurative or literal meaning in the context of ""My mother said she's going to go on game anyway,"" let's break down the potential meanings:

- If the term ""on game"" figuratively means that she is going to participate or be engaged in something (like being focused or involved in an activity), then it would be figurative.
- If the term ""on the game"" is a direct reference to an activity or an actual game, it would be literal.

Given the phrasing, ""My mother said she's going to go on game anyway,"" it seems contextually unusual and unclear. It might be better expressed as:

- ""My mother said she's going to go on with the game anyway,"" which would clearly refer to a literal game.
- ""My mother said she's going to be on her game anyway,"" which would clearly convey a figurative sense of being focused or prepared.

But, as it stands, the phrase ""on the game"" is often a colloquial or idiomatic expression which can refer to being involved in a certain field or activity (sometimes it has negative connotations depending on usage). Given the information and avoiding assumptions, I'll infer the most plausible interpretation based on common usage. 

The sentence itself appears to strain literal and common figurative language, suggesting it might align more with figurative interpretation about participation or engagement in an activity, despite ambiguous phrasing.

Based on the given structure and typical idiom understanding:

Output: `i`",i
on the game,"The expression ""on the game"" in the given context most commonly holds a figurative meaning. It is a British slang term that refers to being involved in prostitution.

Hence, the output is ""i"".",i
flash in the pan,"The expression 'flash in the pan' in the sentence 'I do n't , I think it was just a flash in the pan .' holds a figurative meaning. Therefore, the output should be 'i'.",i

In your example ""Get a life !"", without additional context implying otherwise, it is safe to assume it holds figurative meaning. Therefore, the appropriate output is:

sink or swim,i,i
sink or swim,i,i
sink or swim,"To determine whether the expression 'sink or swim' holds figurative or literal meaning in this context, we need to analyze how it is used.

The expression 'sink or swim' is often used figuratively to imply that someone must either succeed or fail on their own, usually in a challenging situation. However, in a literal context, it would refer to the actual physical action of either sinking or swimming in water.

In the given context: ‘He threw him in there newly dead, and Benedetta with him living, to sink or swim together.’, the phrase describes throwing someone who is dead and someone who is alive into a situation where their literal physical survival (whether they will sink or swim) is in question.

Since the context mentions someone being 'thrown' and involves individuals who are 'newly dead' and 'living', it strongly suggests that it is describing a literal situation in which their literal capacity to sink or swim in water and essentially survive is in question.

Therefore, the expression holds a literal meaning here.

in the fast lane,"To determine whether the expression ""in the fast lane"" holds a figurative or literal meaning, you need to assess the context in which it is used. 

- **i**: if ""in the fast lane"" is used metaphorically to describe a busy, hectic, or high-energy lifestyle.
  
- **l**: if ""in the fast lane"" is used to describe the physical lane on a road where cars typically travel at higher speeds.

For example:

1. **Figurative Context**:
   - ""Ever since she got that promotion, she's been living in the fast lane.""
   - In this case, 'i' would be the output because it describes a high-paced lifestyle rather than a physical location on a road.

2. **Literal Context**:
   - ""He was caught speeding in the fast lane on the highway.""
   - In this case, 'l' would be the output because it refers to the actual fast lane on the road.

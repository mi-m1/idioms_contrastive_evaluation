take no prisoners,"To determine whether the phrase 'no prisoners were taken' holds figurative or literal meaning in this context, we need to consider the surrounding information and usage. However, since you've asked for a general rule:

- The expression 'take no prisoners' is figurative when it means to approach a situation with intense and ruthless determination, showing no mercy or compromise.
- It is literal if it refers to an actual situation where no enemy combatants are captured or taken as prisoners in a conflict.

Without additional context, I cannot definitively determine the meaning in your specific case. Therefore, generally:

- If the phrase is used in a military or combat-related context directly referring to a real scenario, output 'l'.
- If used in a metaphorical or idiomatic sense to describe determination or ruthlessness in any kind of competitive or challenging situation, output 'i'.

Here, the default interpretation in the absence of additional context is:

six of the best,i
six of the best,"To determine whether the expression 'six of the best' holds figurative meaning or literal meaning in the context 'Six of the best or pieces of eight ?', we need to analyze the surrounding text and context clues.

The phrase 'six of the best' typically refers to a form of corporal punishment consisting of six strikes with a cane or similar instrument. This punishment is often referred to in historical or educational contexts.

Meanwhile, 'pieces of eight' refers to old Spanish coins worth eight reales, famously associated with pirates and treasure.

Based on the context of juxtaposing 'six of the best' with 'pieces of eight', it seems more likely that both phrases are used in a figurative or historical context rather than a literal one, as the expression doesn't seem to indicate an actual physical punishment or coins.

Therefore, the output should be:

on the game,"The expression 'on the game' in this context refers to involvement in prostitution. Therefore, it holds a literal meaning when describing what the person was doing. The output should be 'l'."
on the game,"To determine whether the expression 'on the game' holds a figurative or literal meaning in the given sentence 'My mother said she's going to go on game anyway.', we need to understand the context and typical use of the expression.

1. If 'on the game' is used figuratively, it might be referring to engaging in an activity, following a plan, or possibly making a bold decision regardless of the circumstances.
2. If 'on the game' is used literally, it can mean participating in an actual game, such as a sport, board game, or any other structured play activity.

Given no additional context to clarify whether 'game' refers to a literal activity or a metaphorical or slang term, we lean on common uses. 'On the game' is a British slang phrase that can mean working as a prostitute. It is also possible that 'going on game' might not be a standard idiom but could contextually mean engaging in a planned action.

Without more context, the safest interpretation per UK slang could be 'i' (figurative), as it suggests engaging in something despite potential advisories or conditions.

'My mother said she's going to go on game anyway.' likely means proceeding with a determined course of action, thus:

`Output: i`"
on the game,"Without additional context, it's challenging to determine whether the phrase ""on the game"" is used figuratively or literally. However, the expression ""on the game"" commonly refers to someone being involved in prostitution. Based on this more prevalent meaning, the expression in the sentence “They think I'm on the game” is likely figurative.

Therefore, the output should be: **i**."

The phrase 'He 's got his life and I 've got nothing.' can be interpreted figuratively. It suggests that the speaker feels that the other person has something valuable (a fulfilling life, purpose, or happiness) whereas they themselves feel they have nothing of the sort.

Since the sentiment expressed here is about comparing lives and emphasizing a lack of fulfillment or value in one's own life in contrast to another person's life, this holds a figurative meaning.

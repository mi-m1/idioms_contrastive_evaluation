heart of gold,"In this context, the phrase ""heart of gold"" is used to describe the result of the alchemist's transmutation, suggesting that the lead has been transformed into something valuable and precious.

However, given that the context is a casino and specifically involves betting at a poker table, the phrase ""all bets are off"" could also be interpreted literally, meaning that any bets placed are canceled or voided due to the fraudulent activities.

Considering the setting (a casino) and the activity (betting at a poker table), the literal interpretation seems more direct and relevant.

cap in hand,"In the given context, ""With his cap in hand, he stepped forward to greet the queen,"" the expression 'cap in hand' is used to signify a gesture of respect. Historically, removing one's cap or hat and holding it in one's hand was a physical act that denoted deference or respect, especially in the presence of royalty or someone of higher social status. However, the phrase itself can be interpreted in two ways: literally, as describing the physical act of holding one's cap in hand, or figuratively, as indicating an attitude of humility or respect without necessarily performing the physical act.

Given the context, where the act of stepping forward to greet the queen suggests a formal or respectful setting, the expression could be interpreted as both a literal description of the action taken and a figurative expression of the respect shown. However, since the question prompts for a choice between literal and figurative, and considering the historical context where such a gesture was a common practice (thus, emphasizing the physical act as a sign of respect), the expression leans more towards holding a literal meaning in this specific context.

output: l"

cap in hand,"In the given context, ""cap in hand"" is used to describe someone who is standing with their cap removed, likely as a sign of respect or possibly due to the wind, and is literally holding it in their hand.

However, in this specific context, considering the person's fear of water and the physical action of being dragged, it's plausible that the phrase could be interpreted both figuratively (to show resistance) and literally (actually kicking and screaming in protest). But given the intensity of the situation described (being dragged), it leans more towards a literal interpretation of physical resistance.

Output: l"

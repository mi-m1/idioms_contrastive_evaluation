up to here,"To determine whether the expression ""up to here"" is used figuratively or literally, let's analyze the sentence. The sentence is ""She stacked the books up to here on the shelf."" In this context, ""up to here"" is likely accompanied by a gesture indicating the height to which the books were stacked. This implies a physical, tangible measure that corresponds directly to the literal space being described.

Therefore, considering the direct reference to a physical location and the implication of a gesture to indicate height, the expression ""up to here"" is used literally in this sentence.

fall from grace,"In the sentence, ""In the classic novel, the character's literal fall from grace was represented by him tumbling down from the church's high tower,"" the phrase ""fall from grace"" is typically used figuratively to mean a loss of status, respect, or favor, often due to a mistake or wrongdoing. However, the sentence also includes a literal interpretation where the character physically falls from a height, which serves as a metaphor for the figurative ""fall from grace.""

Given the dual use here, where the phrase is primarily figurative but is illustrated through a literal action, the most accurate interpretation in the context of the question would lean towards the figurative use, as that is the primary meaning of ""fall from grace.""

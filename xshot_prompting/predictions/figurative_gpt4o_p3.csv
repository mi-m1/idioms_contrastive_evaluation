jump through hoops,"The expression 'jump through hoops' in the given context holds figurative meaning. Therefore, the output is 'i'."
jump through hoops,"To determine if the expression 'jump through hoops' is being used figuratively or literally, we would need to examine the specific context in which it appears. Unfortunately, the provided text 'Jumps through hoops .' does not offer enough context to make this determination. 

However, based on the typical usage of 'jump through hoops,' it is often used figuratively to describe someone doing several difficult or complicated tasks to achieve something. Literal usage would depict someone physically jumping through circular objects, such as hoops.

Given the lack of context, I cannot definitively determine whether it's figurative or literal here. In a complete context, you would follow this logic:

1. **Figurative Meaning**: If the context suggests someone is undertaking a series of challenging efforts or navigating bureaucratic obstacles.
2. **Literal Meaning**: If the context describes someone physically performing the act of leaping through circular objects.

Since we don't have sufficient context here:

- **Output 'i' for figurative meaning**.
- **Output 'l' for literal meaning**.

But no output can be determined with the provided text alone."

Output: l"
go to town,"To determine whether the expression ""go to town"" is used figuratively or literally in the sentence ""Mr Devey went to town,"" let's analyze the possible meanings:

1. Literal Meaning: If the sentence is implying that Mr. Devey physically traveled to a town, then the expression is used literally.

2. Figurative Meaning: If the sentence is suggesting that Mr. Devey did something with great enthusiasm, thoroughness, or energy, then the expression is used figuratively.

However, to make an accurate determination, we would typically need additional context surrounding the sentence.

Since the context is not provided, we need to infer the most likely usage based on common language patterns. Without further context, the phrase appears to describe a physical action of traveling to town, especially because it is just a simple statement without additional descriptive language that indicates a figurative use.

Therefore, based on the given information, the expression ""Mr Devey went to town"" holds a literal meaning:

take no prisoners,"To determine whether the expression ""take no prisoners"" holds a figurative or literal meaning in the context of the sentence ""No prisoners were taken."", we need to examine the context and connotation of the sentence.

Given the unspecified nature of the sentence, it lacks the specific details that would enable a clear distinction of intent. However, in a purely generic interpretation:

- If ""No prisoners were taken."" is part of a narrative, especially historical or military, it is more likely to be understood literally, indicating that during a conflict, prisoners were not captured.

- If the sentence appears in a context related to competition, sports, or an aggressive business strategy, it might be figurative, implying ruthless or uncompromising behavior.

Since the prompt does not provide additional context or surrounding sentences, the safest inference is to interpret the sentence literally because it more naturally aligns with a direct, historical, or military scenario.

Therefore, the output is:

in your dreams,"To determine whether the expression 'in your dreams' is used figuratively or literally, consider its context. Typically, 'in your dreams' is a figurative expression used to indicate that something is highly unlikely or impossible. However, if the context involves discussing actual dreams during sleep, it could be literal. Let's apply this to the given context: 'In your dreams !'.

The sentence 'In your dreams !' is an emphatic exclamation, often used to tell someone that what they are hoping for will never happen. This is a clear use of the figurative meaning.

Thus, the output is: 'i'."

six of the best,"To determine whether the expression 'six of the best' is used figuratively or literally in the given context 'Six of the best or pieces of eight ?', it is important to understand the context and the usual meaning of the expressions involved.

1. ""Six of the best"" is commonly a British euphemism that historically refers to six strokes of the cane, a form of corporal punishment, typically in schools.
2. ""Pieces of eight"" refers to old Spanish currency, often associated with pirates.

Given these two meanings, we can infer that the context is likely comparing two different concepts — a form of punishment versus a form of reward or wealth. This contrast likely holds figurative meaning, playing on the stark differences between them.

Therefore, the expression 'six of the best' in the context 'Six of the best or pieces of eight ?' holds figurative meaning.

Output:

It seems to indicate a sudden and brief success or occurrence (like an explosion) that leads to a larger impact (blowing the Gents to pieces). Because 'flash in the pan' typically means a momentary success that doesn't lead to lasting results, and in this context, it suggests a momentary surge that led to significant consequences, it is likely being used figuratively.

Therefore, the output is:
'i'"
flash in the pan,i

'er any angle they can get , get a grip of .'

'Get a grip' could be interpreted in a literal sense as in physically grabbing hold of something, or in a figurative sense, meaning to gain control or composure. The expression in the given sentence seems to suggest seizing or grasping any angle they can manage, which implies a literal sense of physically getting a hold on something. 

Based on this analysis, the appropriate output is:

The expression ""get the boot"" typically means to be fired or dismissed from a position or job, which is a figurative usage. However, it could be used literally to mean that someone has received or got a boot (a type of footwear).

Given the lack of additional context in the provided sentence, there is ambiguity. But generally speaking, if someone says ""I've got the boot"" and it stands alone, it more often suggests the figurative meaning of being dismissed or fired.

So, in this context, the expression most likely holds a figurative meaning.

Output: `i`"

on and off,"To determine if the expression ""on and off"" is used figuratively or literally in the given sentence ""And with a lead on and off do you see ."", let's first analyze the expression in general.

""On and off"" can mean something that happens intermittently or sporadically, which is a figurative use. It can also refer to a physical state of being alternately activated and deactivated, which is a literal use.

Given the sentence: ""And with a lead on and off do you see ."", the context appears to be incomplete, but we can still infer certain meanings. The phrase ""with a lead on and off"" suggests that the ""lead"" (which could refer to a situation where someone or something is ahead in some form of competition or task) alternates between being ahead and not being ahead, which would be a figurative use to describe fluctuating circumstances.

Thus, the expression ""on and off"" in this context holds figurative meaning.

1. ""**After the team lost, the opposing fans were not content with just celebrating; they put the boot in by chanting insults at the defeated players.**""
   - In this sentence, the expression is used figuratively, as it refers to making a bad situation worse by adding insult to injury.

2. ""**During the fight, one guy was already down, and then another came over to literally put the boot in.**""
   - In this sentence, the expression is used literally, as it describes someone physically kicking another person with a boot.

Applying this to your instruction to output 'i' for figurative and 'l' for literal:

Here is the decision for sample expressions:
1. ""**After the team lost, the opposing fans were not content with just celebrating; they put the boot in by chanting insults at the defeated players.**""

in the fast lane,"To determine if the expression 'in the fast lane' holds figurative or literal meaning in a given context, we need to examine how it's used within that context. 

Let's consider the context: 'In the fast lane'.

This phrase on its own is not enough to determine the meaning. For proper assessment, one needs to see its usage in a sentence or paragraph. Without additional context, it is ambiguous. The phrase 'in the fast lane' can mean:
- Figuratively: living a fast-paced or high-risk lifestyle usually characterized by excitement, danger, or a lot of activity.
- Literally: being in a designated fast lane on a road or highway.

Given the options:
- If 'in the fast lane' holds a figurative meaning, output 'i'.
- If 'in the fast lane' holds a literal meaning, output 'l'. 

Example assessment:

1. **Figurative Usage:** ""After getting his promotion, John started living life in the fast lane, attending parties, traveling frequently, and making risky investments.""
   - Output: 'i'

2. **Literal Usage:** ""The car sped past us in the fast lane, ignoring the speed limit.""
   - Output: 'l'

In conclusion, to categorize the expression accurately as either figurative ('i') or literal ('l'), additional context is necessary. In its isolated form 'In the fast lane', the meaning can't be definitively ascertained. If you provide more context or sentences, I'd be able to give a precise answer."

bring home the bacon,"The expression 'bring home the bacon' in the provided context holds a figurative meaning. 

Output: **i**"
bring home the bacon,"To determine whether the expression ""bring home the bacon"" is used figuratively or literally, we need to analyze the context in which it appears. Here’s a general guideline for determining the usage:

1. **Figurative Meaning** (often means to earn money for the household):
   - If the phrase is used in contexts related to earning money, supporting the family, gaining success, or similar abstract concepts, it holds a figurative meaning.

2. **Literal Meaning** (means actual bacon or a physical item being brought home):
   - If the phrase is used in contexts involving actual bacon or food being physically brought to a home, it holds a literal meaning.

Given an example, you would apply this criteria to determine the output.

Let's analyze a few scenarios:

1. **Example Context**: ""After working two jobs, she managed to bring home the bacon and pay the bills.""
   - This refers to earning money to support the household. **Output: i**

2. **Example Context**: ""He left the grocery store and brought home the bacon for breakfast.""
   - This refers to physically bringing bacon from the store. **Output: l**

3. **Example Context**: ""Despite the odds, the team managed to bring home the bacon in the final minutes of the game.""
   - This refers to achieving success or victory, metaphorically. **Output: i**

By applying this logic, you can determine the correct output based on the context. If you have a specific example to analyze, you can use this approach to figure out whether to output 'i' or 'l'."

under the table,"To determine whether the expression 'under the table' holds figurative or literal meaning in the context 'we were nearly under the table', consider the usual contexts in which this idiom is used. The expression 'under the table' is commonly used figuratively to mean doing something secretly or illicitly. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if it is meant literally (e.g., physically being under a table) or figuratively (e.g., nearly drunk enough to be under the table).

Given that the phrase is ""we were nearly under the table,"" it suggests a state or condition that is almost happening. The figurative meaning ""nearly under the table"" is often used to describe nearing a state of being very drunk or overwhelmed.

Thus, in this particular context, the expression 'under the table' holds a figurative meaning:

Output: 'i'"
watch this space,i
watch this space,"To solve this, let’s break down what it means for an expression to be used literally or figuratively:

- **Literal Meaning:** The expression is used in its most basic, straightforward sense.
- **Figurative Meaning:** The expression is used in a symbolic, metaphorical, or idiomatic way.

The expression 'watch this space' typically advises the reader or listener to pay attention for future developments or updates. It’s generally used figuratively to suggest that something noteworthy will happen or be announced soon.

So, in your example, if we encounter:
- **""Watch this space.""**

It would usually imply that there is something forthcoming or expected to happen, which is a figurative use because the space in question isn't a literal, physical space the reader needs to watch but rather a metaphor for upcoming developments.

Thus, the output for the given example is:

turn the screw,i
turn the screw,"To determine if the expression 'turn the screw' holds a figurative or literal meaning in the given context 'Tordo turns the screw …', we analyze the context and typical usage of the phrase. 'Turn the screw' is often used figuratively to mean increasing pressure or intensity, typically in a metaphorical sense. However, it can also be used literally to describe the physical action of turning a screw.

Since the provided context 'Tordo turns the screw …' is incomplete and does not provide clear indications, we would typically look for additional surrounding text to make a definitive judgment. Given the fragment alone:

1. If 'Tordo' is involved in a situation where tension, pressure, or urgency is being increased, the expression likely holds a figurative meaning.
2. If 'Tordo' is engaged in an activity that involves physically turning a screw or using tools, it likely holds a literal meaning.

Without additional context, it is challenging to ascertain the precise nature, but as an initial assessment:

- If there were more context suggesting a situation of increasing pressure or tension, 'i' would be appropriate.
- If there were more context suggesting the action of using a tool or a mechanical task, 'l' would be appropriate.

Please provide additional context for a more accurate determination."

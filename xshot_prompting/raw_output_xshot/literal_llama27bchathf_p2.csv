Either generate 'output: i' if figurative, or generate the letter 'output: l' if literal. Only generate the letter after 'output: '. 
Here is an example: The expression 'big cheese' occurs figuratively in the sentence: 'Such as washing dishes at restaurants at just 14, or working his backside off alongside big cheese Michael Meredith at The Grove.', and literally in the setence: 'She had difficulty slicing the big cheese because of its hard rind.'. [/INST]  Understood! For the sentence ""He fell asleep with a closed book resting on his chest,"" the expression ""closed book"" is used literally. Therefore, I will generate the letter 'output: l'."

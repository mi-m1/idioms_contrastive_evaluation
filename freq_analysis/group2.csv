out of the blue,
things that go bump in the night,
full of beans,
to the bone,
in the driving seat,
nip and tuck,
all over the map,
out to lunch,
to die for,
in black and white,
toe the line,
high and mighty,
dead in the water,
take no prisoners,
cut and thrust,
steal someone's thunder,
fly a kite,
to the hilt,
force someone's hand,
cap in hand,
for a song,
push someone's buttons,
joined at the hip,
on the button,
get off the ground,
on the back burner,
have someone's number,
make a move,
pay the piper,
grind to a halt,
follow in someone's footsteps,
on the rocks,
with open arms,
reach for the stars,
kiss of death,
out of the picture,
carry the can,
go to the wall,
see the light of day,
heart of gold,
out of line,
jump on the bandwagon,
pick up the pieces,
down the drain,
ride roughshod over,
on the game,
fire in the belly,
fall from grace,
make a clean break,
pick someone's brain,
tip the scales,
out of order,
sit on the fence,
rob Peter to pay Paul,
the icing on the cake,
grasp the nettle,
in the driver's seat,
down the tubes,
on a roll,
double cross,
walk the plank,
all bets are off,
turn the other cheek,
raise the roof,
out of the woods,
blood and guts,
under the microscope,
fight fire with fire,
take a hike,
smell a rat,
wake up and smell the coffee,
fun and games,
one of those things,
get a rise out of,
eat humble pie,
throw the baby out with the bathwater,
know the score,
add fuel to the fire,
burst someone's bubble,
under a cloud,
throw the book at,
between a rock and a hard place,
in your dreams,
get a grip,
in the loop,
up a tree,
save someone's skin,
sick and tired,
don't hold your breath,
get under someone's skin,
heart and soul,
behind the scenes,
push the envelope,
in bed with,
circle the wagons,
do the right thing,
neither here nor there,
on the ball,
make the cut,
song and dance,
push the boat out,
run a mile,
close to home,
on the cards,
separate the wheat from the chaff,
turn the screw,
pass the buck,
on the shelf,
when the chips are down,
on the same page,
have a heart,
get stuck in,
nuts and bolts,
play with fire,
on the side of the angels,
round the bend,
on the bounce,
keep tabs on,
water under the bridge,
in the red,
cast the first stone,
fly in the face of,
on the fly,
hammer and tongs,
at sixes and sevens,
head over heels,
in the black,
doom and gloom,
take a bath,
call a spade a spade,
closed book,
power behind the throne,
dyed in the wool,
kick the bucket,
fly off the handle,
point the finger,
face to face,
strike while the iron is hot,
everything but the kitchen sink,
in the offing,
over the moon,
face the music,
spit it out,
stand up and be counted,
bring home the bacon,
the bee's knees,
move the goalposts,
blaze a trail,
behind someone's back,
dig up dirt,
fill someone's shoes,
to the tune of,
crocodile tear,
look on the bright side,
off and running,
left and right,
short and sweet,
rule the roost,
spill the beans,
black and blue,
let the cat out of the bag,
peaches and cream,
drop the ball,
the buck stops here,
cut the mustard,
draw a line in the sand,
on the wagon,
step on it,
watch this space,
up to here,
oil and water,
in the soup,
on and off,
in the bag,
on a shoestring,
pop the question,
come with the territory,
join the club,
free and easy,
take the fall,
grease the wheels,
under the wire,
come in from the cold,
put the boot in,
fashion plate,
jump through hoops,
fast and furious,
hold the line,
out of the loop,
have a few,
press the panic button,
under the sun,
smoke and mirrors,
clear the decks,
the ball is in someone's court,
shut the door on,
see eye to eye,
down the road,
go all the way,
six feet under,
cut and dried,
blue blood,
moment of truth,
horses for courses,
across the board,
go to town,
pull the plug,
out of the box,
night and day,
six of the best,
far and away,
full speed ahead,
keep the peace,
in someone's pocket,
in the doghouse,
swings and roundabouts,
run out of steam,
flower child,
under the weather,
par for the course,
in your face,
touch and go,
take a back seat,
pour cold water on,
get the boot,
below the belt,
under the table,
meat and potatoes,
in the final analysis,
down to the wire,
go the distance,
in a nutshell,
take a dive,
eat someone alive,
licence to print money,
at a canter,
crash and burn,
take the bull by the horns,
see the light,
up in the air,
against the grain,
in the hole,
go with the flow,
carrot and stick,
tie the knot,
in the pink,
muddy the waters,
keep a lid on,
all over the place,
shoot the messenger,
bells and whistles,
head for the hills,
break someone's heart,
up to speed,
put words in someone's mouth,
go for the jugular,
get the picture,
cook the books,
on thin ice,
by the book,
go the extra mile,
twist someone's arm,
in the clear,
make a killing,
feel the pinch,
get away with murder,
cut both ways,
get to grips with,
fall in line,
turn the tables,
have a ball,
with a view to,
hit the nail on the head,
hair of the dog,
open the floodgates,
panda car,
batten down the hatches,
no strings attached,
cut from the same cloth,
dead and buried,
sing the praises of,
wet behind the ears,
rise and shine,
over the hill,
in cold blood,
make a meal of,
up the ante,
turn over a new leaf,
light at the end of the tunnel,
night owl,
busy bee,
throw down the gauntlet,
rise from the ashes,
old flame,
on the trot,
knock someone's socks off,
at the end of the day,
scratch the surface,
break the ice,
on the warpath,
kicking and screaming,
do someone proud,
behind closed doors,
acid test,
get it up,
top dog,
bad hat,
apples and oranges,
heads will roll,
look the part,
ring a bell,
make a splash,
sign on the dotted line,
on the hop,
spend a penny,
pound the pavement,
kangaroo court,
get to the bottom of,
big fish,

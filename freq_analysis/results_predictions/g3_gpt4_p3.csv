in the fast lane,"To determine whether the expression ""in the fast lane"" holds a figurative or literal meaning, you need to assess the context in which it is used. 

- **i**: if ""in the fast lane"" is used metaphorically to describe a busy, hectic, or high-energy lifestyle.
  
- **l**: if ""in the fast lane"" is used to describe the physical lane on a road where cars typically travel at higher speeds.

For example:

1. **Figurative Context**:
   - ""Ever since she got that promotion, she's been living in the fast lane.""

2. **Literal Context**:
   - ""He was caught speeding in the fast lane on the highway.""
   - In this case, 'l' would be the output because it refers to the actual fast lane on the road.

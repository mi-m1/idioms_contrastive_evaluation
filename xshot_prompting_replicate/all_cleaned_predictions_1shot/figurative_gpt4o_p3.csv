horses for courses,"The expression 'horses for courses' is typically used figuratively to indicate that different people or things are suited to different tasks or situations. In the context you provided, the meaning should be determined based on whether the expression is used to describe an actual situation involving horses or if it's being used metaphorically to describe suitability for different tasks.

Here is the process to determine the output:

1. If 'horses for courses' is used figuratively (to imply that different people or things are suitable for different tasks), output 'i'.
2. If 'horses for courses' is used literally (to describe an actual situation involving horses and courses), output 'l'.

Let's evaluate some example sentences for clarity:

1. ""In project planning, it's a case of horses for courses, as different team members excel in different areas.""  
   - This sentence uses the expression figuratively, so the output is 'i'.

Given this analysis, the expression 'is well out of order' holds a figurative meaning. Therefore, the output is 'i'."

move the goalposts,i
move the goalposts,"Certainly! Let's apply the rule to determine if ""move the goalposts"" holds a figurative or literal meaning in the context provided. 

Here is the process:

1. If the expression is being used to describe a change in rules, expectations, or standards in a non-physical, metaphorical manner, it is figurative. 
2. If the expression is used to describe the actual physical act of changing the location of literal goalposts (e.g., in a sports field), it is literal.

Example Analysis:
- ""The committee decided to move the goalposts in the middle of the project, changing the success criteria entirely.""

Here, ""move the goalposts"" is figurative, referring to changing standards or criteria.

- ""After the storm damaged the field, the groundskeepers had to move the goalposts back into position.""

Here, ""move the goalposts"" is literal as it describes physically repositioning goalposts.

Now, let’s evaluate an example sentence of the provided expression:

**Example:** ""Frustrated with the project's progress, the manager decided to move the goalposts by setting new deadlines.""

Output: **i** 

Explanation: In the example, ""move the goalposts"" is being used figuratively to describe altering the rules or expectations (e.g., setting new deadlines) in a non-physical manner."

oil and water,"The expression 'oil and water do n't mix' in the sentence provided should be categorized as:

- ""l"" for literal meaning 
- ""i"" for figurative meaning

The context provided does not specify a sentence, so I'll provide an analysis of a sample usage:

1. If the sentence is: ""Oil and water do n't mix, which is why you need an emulsifier to make salad dressing.""
   - This usage is literal because it refers to the physical properties of oil and water.

2. If the sentence is: ""They're like oil and water; their personalities just don't mix.""
   - This usage is figurative because it uses the phrase metaphorically to describe how two people are incompatible.

To provide the correct output, the specific sentence context for 'oil and water do n't mix' is necessary. Without more information, I'll assume your example is general and follows the provided sentences. So I would classify:

- 'Oil and water do n't mix.' — ""l"" (literal meaning in general scientific context)

Output: i"
pay the piper,"Sure, I can help with that. Let's analyze the context for the expression 'pay the piper'. 

1. If 'Who pays the piper …' refers to dealing with the consequences, fulfilling responsibilities, or settling debts or dues in a metaphorical sense, then the expression is being used figuratively.
2. If 'Who pays the piper …' refers to literally paying a musician or performer, then it is being used literally. 

For instance:

- If the sentence is: ""After years of avoiding taxes, now it's time to see who pays the piper for the economic crisis,"" this use would be figurative as it deals with facing the consequences.
- If the sentence is: ""At the festival, we need to figure out who pays the piper for the evening's performance,"" this use would be literal as it describes literally paying a musician.

Without a specific sentence, based on the given prompt format, let's proceed with the identification:

things that go bump in the night,"To determine whether the expression ""things that go bump in the night"" is used figuratively or literally in the context provided, we usually need additional information from the surrounding text. However, since only the given sentence is provided, let’s assess it based on the general usage and understanding of the phrase:

The expression ""things that go bump in the night"" often refers to unknown and potentially frightening occurrences that happen during the night, typically causing anxiety or fear.

Here is the sentence for analysis: ""Things that go bump in the night.""

Considering this sentence, the phrase seems to be used in its common, figurative sense. There is no specific suggestion of physical objects causing bumps; rather, it implies mysterious or scary phenomena happening during the night.

six of the best,"To determine if the expression 'six of the best' holds figurative or literal meaning in the context 'Six of the best or pieces of eight ?', we need to understand the phrase and its usage. The expression 'six of the best' typically refers to a form of corporal punishment involving six strikes, historically given by a schoolteacher. In the context of the sentence provided, it contrasts 'six of the best' with 'pieces of eight,' which are coins associated with pirates.

Given this contrast, 'six of the best' is likely being used figuratively to represent punishment or a challenge, while 'pieces of eight' symbolize reward or treasure.

Therefore, the expression 'six of the best' in the context 'Six of the best or pieces of eight ?' holds a figurative meaning.

Output: 'i'"
six of the best,"To determine whether the expression 'six of the best' is used figuratively or literally in the context 'There 's six of the best', we need to analyze the phrase's meaning and the context provided. 

'Six of the best' typically refers to a punishment in which six strokes of a cane or similar implement are given, often in a school setting. This would be a literal meaning if referring directly to the physical act. However, it can also be used figuratively to mean a selection of the best six items or individuals in a given category.

Given the limited context (there is no detailed context about the nature of the items or the scenario it refers to), the phrase 'There 's six of the best' likely holds a figurative meaning since it can be interpreted as referring to a list or group of the best six items or people.

Therefore, the correct output is:

Given the known figurative meaning of 'on the game,' we can assume that this is the intended usage in this context.

Therefore, the appropriate output would be 'i'."
on the game,"To determine if the expression ""on the game"" in the sentence ""They think I 'm on the game ."" holds a figurative or literal meaning, we need to understand the typical usage of this phrase. The expression ""on the game"" is a British slang term that often means being involved in prostitution. This is a figurative meaning since it implies engagement in a specific illicit activity rather than participating in an actual game.

Given this understanding, the expression ""on the game"" in the sentence ""They think I 'm on the game ."" holds a figurative meaning.

Output: `i`"

flash in the pan,i
flash in the pan,"To determine if the expression 'flash in the pan' holds a figurative or literal meaning in the context 'Flash in pan blew Gents to pieces', let's break down the sentence:

1. **Expression Definition**:
   - **Figurative:** 'Flash in the pan' commonly means a brief, intense effort or display that ends in failure or doesn't deliver continuing results.
   - **Literal:** 'Flash in the pan' originates from flintlock muskets where the gunpowder in the pan flashed but didn't fire the shot.

2. **Context Analysis:**
   - The phrase 'blew Gents to pieces' suggests a physical explosion or destructive event.
   - Given the destructive implication in 'blew...to pieces', it appears to be referencing an actual explosive event rather than a short-lived success or failure.

Since the context suggests a physical event involving an explosion, the expression 'flash in the pan' is likely intended in a literal sense here.

Hence, the output is:

**l**"

put the boot in,"Given the context of the task, let's analyze the provided expression to determine if it holds figurative or literal meaning:

'PUTTING THE BOOT IN'.

The phrase 'putting the boot in' typically has a figurative meaning, often implying that someone is taking advantage of a situation where another person is already at a disadvantage, by being especially harsh or aggressive. However, it can also be used literally to describe someone physically kicking someone else.

1. Figurative use example: ""After the player fell to the ground, the opposing team leader was accused of putting the boot in by making insensitive comments about his injury.""
2. Literal use example: ""During the chaotic rush, someone kept putting the boot in, kicking the fallen protester repeatedly.""

Since the phrase 'PUTTING THE BOOT IN' has not been placed in a specific sentence in your query, let's consider the term in a vacuum and typically, compilations or books of phrases would contain titles in their figurative sense primarily.

In this context:

There is insufficient context to definitively determine whether it is used figuratively or literally. 'i' would indicate a figurative meaning (sexual connotation), and 'l' would indicate a literal meaning (raising or lifting something). In an exam-like scenario without additional context, it is challenging to ascertain the exact usage.

However, on most occasions, 'get it up' tends to be interpreted figuratively. Therefore, I will output 'i':

bring home the bacon,i
bring home the bacon,"To determine whether the expression 'bring home the bacon' is used figuratively or literally in a given context, you'll need to analyze the surrounding text to see if it conveys an idiomatic meaning (where 'bring home the bacon' usually means to earn a living or achieve success) or if it talks about actual bacon being brought home.

Here is how you can assess the context for a hypothetical example:

1. If the context suggests someone earning money or achieving something valuable, output 'i'.
2. If the context suggests physically bringing actual bacon or food home, output 'l'.

Let's look at an example:

""The expression 'bring home the bacon' occurs in the sentence: 'After months of job searching, he finally found a position that allowed him to bring home the bacon again.'""

In this case, the expression is figurative because it talks about earning money, not literal bacon. Therefore, the correct output is 'i'.

Now, consider another example:

""The expression 'bring home the bacon' occurs in the sentence: 'She went to the market early in the morning and managed to bring home the bacon for breakfast.'""

In this context, the expression is used literally because it refers to actually bringing bacon home from the market. Therefore, the correct output is 'l'.

By applying this method, you can determine the meaning of the expression in various contexts."

If the statement relates to such inherent expectations or challenges and is not talking about literal land or territory, then it is figurative ('i'). If literal land or geographical territory is being discussed, then it would be literal ('l').

Here is the context to be analyzed with the expression: 'It comes with the territory …'

But based on the nature of the question (comparing with expressions like 'play with fire'), if there is no additional context indicating physical activity involving a screw, it is reasonable to assume 'turn the screw' here is likely figurative.

Given the incomplete sentence 'Tordo turns the screw …', without additional context, I'll output 'i':

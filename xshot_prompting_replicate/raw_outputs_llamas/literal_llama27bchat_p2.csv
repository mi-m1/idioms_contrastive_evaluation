The correct sentence should be ""The horse moved around the field at a canter, showing off its agility.""

at a canter," Great, I'm glad to help! In the sentence 'She practiced her horse riding skills at a canter, gaining confidence with every step.', the expression 'at a canter' is being used literally. The word 'canter' refers to a type of horse ride where the horse is moved at a moderate pace, typically between a walk and a trot.

twist someone's arm," Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. The expression ""twist someone's arm"" can be used both figuratively and literally, depending on the context.

If the sentence is figurative, I would mark it as ""i"". For example, if someone says ""She was so strong, she could easily twist someone's arm if she wanted to,"" it means that the person is using a metaphor to describe the person's strength, rather than literally twisting someone's arm.

Based on the meaning of the expression, I would answer ""i"" for the expression ""play with fire"" in the sentence:

""The war took away the unfortunate necessity, as Unionists saw it, to play with fire in the national interest, but it did not materially alter their view of themselves.""

This sentence uses the phrase ""play with fire"" figuratively to describe the idea of taking risks or engaging in dangerous activities. The expression is not being used literally to describe the act of playing with actual fire.

On the other hand, the sentence:

in the pink,"To determine whether the expression ""in the pink"" is used figuratively or literally in the context ""In the Pink,"" we need to consider the meanings of the phrase.

""In the pink"" figuratively means in good health or spirits. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the usage with absolute certainty. However, given that ""In the Pink"" is presented as a standalone title or phrase, it's more likely to be an idiomatic expression rather than a literal description of something being pink.

Therefore, based on the typical usage of ""in the pink"" as an idiom for good health or spirits, the expression would be considered figurative.

go to town,output: i
go to town,"To determine whether the expression ""go to town"" holds a figurative or literal meaning in the context ""Mr Devey went to town,"" we need to consider the typical usage of the phrase.

""Go to town"" can literally mean to travel to a town or city, usually for a specific purpose such as shopping, entertainment, or business. However, without more context indicating that ""going to town"" has a special idiomatic meaning here (like spending money freely, doing something enthusiastically, or acting with great energy), the most straightforward interpretation of ""Mr Devey went to town"" would be that he physically traveled to a town.

Therefore, given the provided context does not suggest any special or figurative usage, the expression ""go to town"" holds a literal meaning.

expression: 'closed book'
 sentence: 'He fell asleep with a closed book resting on his chest.' QUESTION: Given the sentence and the expression, tell me if the expression is used figurative or literally. Either generate 'output: i' if figurative, or generate the letter 'output: l' if literal. Only generate the letter after 'output: '. 
Here is an example: The expression 'play with fire' occurs figuratively in the sentence: 'The war took away the unfortunate necessity , as Unionists saw it , to play with fire in the national interest , but it did not materially alter their view of themselves.', and literally in the setence: 'Despite the danger, he decided to play with fire, poking the embers with a stick.'. [/INST]  Understood! Given the sentence ""He fell asleep with a closed book resting on his chest."" and the expression ""closed book,"" I would generate the letter 'l' as the expression is used literally in this sentence.

Output: l"
